          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I am a graphic designer raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and
            trained in the graphic design program at California State University
            East Bay. Though I may not be a storyteller myself, one thing I
            strive to do is capture the feelings of stories being told whether
            that be a story coming from a real life interaction, such as a
            taekwondo instructor and his students, or from music, books, movies,
            and video games. As a fan of all of these forms of storytelling I
            often find inspiration in their creativity and depth which makes me
            strive to always want to be better. It is my ultimate goal to one
            day help a movie or video game studio bring their creation to life.
          </p>

          <p>
            In High School I won an anti smoking poster contest put on by the
            School Wellness and Safety Program by the Alameda County Office of
            Education because of my use of imagery and text in order to convey
            the message. This first success helped spark my creative journey in
            order to learn more about art digitally and physically so that I
            could begin to grow and learn to create work that is entirely my
            own. I have also earned the highest rank in the Boy Scouts of
            America: Eagle Scout. The BSA creates life events for people at a
            young age to help them grow and develop to become active members of
            society. As well as provides rigorous leadership training that helps
            me in all of the leadership opportunities I have today.
