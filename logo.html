            | Program: Illustrator
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is one of my most popular designs. Based on a teacher
            recommendation the principal of Musick Elementary school in Newark
            California asked for my help when the school was in need of a new
            logo. I was given a lot of freedom to design this project and
            therefore made sure to think through every aspect of the design.
            First, I chose to incorporate the school’s mascot, the leopard, and
            the school’s colors (black and gold). To match the school’s
            aesthetic I chose to use a sans serif font for the logo.
            Additionally I used a large thick “M” to support the strong profile
            of the leopard. Although the san serif font worked well for other
            elements of the logo, the “M” itself needed to be manipulated in
            order to fit the profile of the leopard. Ultimately I chose to
            create the “M” from scratch in Illustrator to create the shape that
            would work best. The final product was delivered to the school in
            color, black and white, as well as a monogram version of the “M”
            itself. It is now being prominently used in the school’s
            merchandise, materials, and website.
